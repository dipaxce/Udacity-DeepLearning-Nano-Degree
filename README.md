Dog-Breed Classifier Given an image of a dog, this CNN algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. This project aims to emanate knowledge about various design decisions to be made in the data processing pipeline by piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in the pipeline.
