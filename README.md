1. Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns This project predicts how many bikes will a bike sharing company need in the near future. Having too few on standby would make company lose money form potential riders. Having too many will waste money on bikes that are just sitting around unused. So, a neural network is used to predict the optimal number of bikes needed using historical data. 

2. Dog-Breed Classifier Given an image of a dog, this CNN algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. This project aims to emanate knowledge about various design decisions to be made in the data processing pipeline by piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in the pipeline.
